<h3>What is this application?</h3>

title_of_app was intended to exhibit similar physiological behavior to UberEats/Door Dash

## Motive

As a Full Stack Developer, the primary motive was to build a full-stack MERN application by utilizing an ORM methodology and establishing a MVC framework. Exerting these types of practices provides an organized/clean environment and allows other developers to maneuver around the code with ease.

## Getting Started

<b>To get started:</b>
<br>
:black_small_square: You will need to have an updated IDE (preferably VS Code), and the latest version of Node.js, and an up-to-date version of Express, and Heroku.

### Prerequisites

:black_small_square: IDE: Microsoft Visual Studios 1.37.1 (or higher).
<br>
:black_small_square: Node.js (Version: 12.9.0 or higher)
<br>
:black_small_square: Express - Web application framework designed for building web applications and APIs.
<br>
:black_small_square: Heroku - Container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). Heroku enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
<br>
:black_small_square: MongoDB - cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schema.


## Code Explanation

* The way the code was written out was utilizing ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), while establishing an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework.
  1. 'server.js' that contains the npm packages for express, body-parser, and path. The server.js sets up the app(instance of express) as well as setting up handlebars, and import the routes.
  2. The 'db' folder contains the MySQL data which is primarily... x
  3. The 'public' folder contains primarily the front-end code. It also contains the CSS styling for the web page as well. The folder contains the images/screenshots used in the application.
  4. The 'views' folder contains all of Handlebar's code.
  5. 'controllers' folder contains has the update function
  6. 'config' folder contains the connections and orm model for the application.

## Deployment

* <b> 'git push origin master' & 'git push heroku master' the files into GitHub Profile and Heroku respectively.</b>
* <b> Link repository and Heroku deployment link to BCS.</b>
